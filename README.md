# Environmental Product Declaration Prediction Project
Production of asphalt inherently releases large quantities of many greenhouse gasses. Efforts are currently underway to identify and handle issues related to this greenhouse gas production. One such effort is the use of environmental product declarations (EPDs) which are driven by green public procurement programs. EPDs can provide a quantitative and transparent assesment of the environmental impacts of a product throughout it's lifecycle. Global warming potentials (GWPs) are one important aspect of an EPD.

However, the process of digitalization is time-consuming and constly. Modern tools to generate EPDs require large amounts of primary input data collected over a long 12 month process, including but not limited to:
1. Total produced mixture
2. Transportation distances
3. Electricity used to produce the mixture

The goal of this app is to build a machine learning model with which an individual can provide various inputs regarding the desired asphalt mixture, and quickly receive a predicted GWP based on the data recorded in the US EPD database. Using this tool, asphalt producers and consumers will be able to quickly test different asphalt mixture designs across different states in the United States of America, and in doing so can more easily derive an ideal mixture that balances performance with GWP output.
